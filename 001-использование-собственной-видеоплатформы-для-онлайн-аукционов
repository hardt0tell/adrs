Context
It is reasonable to assume that as a start up, Farmacy Family has limited resources and need to make good use of its resources.

It needs to focus on core domains and expend development effort only in the domains in which it can differentiate itself from the competition.

As heath is the major part of Farmacy Family vision, the Medical domain can be considered its core. This domain includes its unique collaboration with medical professionals and leveraging this to provide better health outcomes for its customers.

It can further differentiate itself by making use of Analytics to improve the efficacy of the decisions which in turn bring better health to its customers.

In all other domains required for forums, organisation of events and classes etc, good commercial or open source alternatives should be considered.

Decision
COTS solution will be used for Forums. We suggest Vanilla Forums. It also provides community events functionality which could provide good starting point before investing in custom solutions.

Consequences
Positive:

Make efficient use of limited resources
Negative:

Integrating with off-the-shelf or open source products can be a challenge.

None of the available off-the-shelf or open source products may be suitable.
Bonus Features:
